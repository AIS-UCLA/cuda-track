Implement 5 CUDA C++ kernels on the python notebook. You can upload the notebook to Colab as the GPUs provided by Free Mode should be enough for this assignment. The solutions are quite simple and mostly consist of 2-5 lines of `if statements/for loops`. If there are any syntax or keywords that are unfamilar, I highly recommend googling it or searching it up in the [CUDA programming guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#programming-model).
