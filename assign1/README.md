# Assignment 1: Puzzle Extravaganza (~1 week to complete)
Implement 5 CUDA C++ kernels on the python notebook. The GPUs provided by Colab Free should be enough for this assignment. The solutions mostly consist of 2-5 lines of code. If there are any syntax or keywords that are unfamilar, I highly recommend googling it or searching it up in the [CUDA programming guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#programming-model).
